# Roadmap for Sleek Minimalistic Portfolio Website

This roadmap outlines the phases, milestones, and steps to build a visually stunning, HTML-and-CSS-only portfolio website for a high school coding competition. The site will feature sections for "About Me," "Skills," and "Interests," replicating the minimalistic, visually satisfying design of a reference portfolio screenshot.

---

## Reference Design
**Screenshots**: Located in `design-references` folder:
- `hero-page.png`: Inspires the About Me section (header/hero design).
- `skills-page.png`: Guides the Skills section layout and style.
- `interests-page.png`: Shapes the Interests section design.
- **Description**: Replicate the layout, typography, color scheme, and animations from these screenshots, adapting for Mugisha’s About Me, Skills, and Interests using `Content.md`.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Structure
**Goal**: Establish the foundational HTML structure with Mugisha’s content and basic CSS styling, mirroring the screenshots’ layout.
**Steps**:
1. Create `index.html` with semantic HTML: `<header>`, `<main>` (with `<section>` tags for About Me, Skills, Interests), and `<footer>`.
2. Populate sections with content from `Content.md` (e.g., Mugisha Patrick’s name, bio, skills, interests) as specified.
3. Link `styles.css` in the `<head>`.
4. Apply a CSS reset and set a color scheme inspired by `hero-page.png`.
5. Use CSS Flexbox or Grid to match the screenshots’ single-column, scrollable layout.

**Success Metrics**:
- `index.html` contains all sections with semantic tags and Mugisha’s content from `Content.md`.
- `styles.css` is linked and applies a reset and screenshot-inspired colors.
- Layout mirrors the screenshots’ structure (e.g., vertical scroll, section spacing).
- File structure is clean: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `Content.md`, and `design-references` folder in the root.

## Phase 2: Hero Section (About Me)
**Goal**: Build a hero section inspired by the screenshot’s style, introducing the user with animations.
**Steps**:
1. Add a `<h1>` for the user’s name and a `<p>` for a tagline in the `<header>` or first `<section>`.
2. Style the background (e.g., gradient, solid color) to match the screenshot’s aesthetic, adding a subtle animation if present (e.g., `background-position` shift).
3. Animate the name and tagline with CSS effects similar to the screenshot (e.g., fade, slide, scale).
4. Include a sticky navigation bar if the screenshot has one, fading in on scroll.

**Success Metrics**:
- Name and tagline animate in a way that echoes the screenshot’s timing and style (e.g., ~1s fade).
- Background matches or adapts the screenshot’s design with optional animation.
- Navigation (if applicable) sticks and appears smoothly after scrolling.
- All effects use CSS only and feel minimalistic.

## Phase 3: Skills Section
**Goal**: Create a skills showcase with layout and animations inspired by the screenshot.
**Steps**:
1. Add a `<section>` with a `<h2>` title "Skills" and a grid or list of skill cards.
2. Match the screenshot’s card or list style (e.g., size, spacing, borders).
3. Animate skill elements (e.g., progress bars, icons) on load, mimicking the screenshot’s motion (e.g., fill, fade).
4. Add hover effects (e.g., scale, shadow) consistent with the screenshot’s interactivity.

**Success Metrics**:
- Skills layout reflects the screenshot’s design (e.g., grid columns, spacing).
- Animations match the screenshot’s style and timing (e.g., ~2s load animation).
- Hover effects enhance cards without cluttering the minimalistic vibe.
- Section stands out yet harmonizes with the overall UI.

---

## Phase 4: Interests Section
**Goal**: Design an interests section with screenshot-inspired visuals and scroll-triggered effects.
**Steps**:
1. Add a `<section>` with a `<h2>` title "Interests" and items (e.g., cards, icons) styled like the screenshot.
2. Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to replicate the screenshot’s arrangement.
3. Animate items to appear as you scroll, adapting the screenshot’s animation style (e.g., fade, slide).
4. Add hover effects (e.g., tilt, glow) that align with the screenshot’s subtle interactivity.

**Success Metrics**:
- Layout and styling echo the screenshot’s design.
- Scroll animations trigger smoothly, matching the screenshot’s vibe (e.g., ~1s per item).
- Hover effects are present and consistent with the reference.
- Section feels cohesive with the portfolio’s minimalistic tone.

---

## Phase 5: Footer and Polish
**Goal**: Finalize the site with a footer and refine it to match the screenshot’s polish.
**Steps**:
1. Add a `<footer>` with social links and a notice, styled like the screenshot’s footer (if present).
2. Animate footer elements (e.g., pulse, fade) if the screenshot includes motion.
3. Use typography (e.g., font family, size) from the screenshot or a close match (e.g., Google Fonts).
4. Ensure responsiveness for mobile (max-width: 600px) and tablet (max-width: 900px), adapting the screenshot’s layout.
5. Polish with consistent spacing, transitions, and colors from the screenshot.

**Success Metrics**:
- Footer mirrors the screenshot’s design with optional animation (e.g., ~2s pulse).
- Site is fully responsive and visually matches the screenshot across devices.
- All CSS effects are smooth and competition-ready.
- Final UI feels sleek, minimalistic, and professional.

## Completion Criteria
- Site replicates the screenshot’s design with About Me, Skills, and Interests sections.
- All features are HTML/CSS-only, responsive, and visually stunning.
- Judges recognize the portfolio’s purpose and are impressed within 10 seconds.
